# mochileApp-Flask

The goal of this app is to make it easy for a fictional tourism company to provide their services to schools, since it is a
common practice here in Chile to travel with your classmates in your final year of school it makes a lot of sense.

Tools I'm using:
-- SQL, with a relational database (MySQL), for data storage.
-- Flask web framework (Python), for tasks like routing, template rendering and more.
-- Javascript for front-end logic such as form validation, some UI animations and AJAX calls to the server. (using jQuery)
-- HTML/CSS(very bad CSS) for core front-end. 

References:
I'm using a very beautiful animation in my home template which was made with Tween.js animation library and I got it from here:

Most of the icons and images I used I got them from here:

Considerations:
I learnt Python while a was learning to use the Flask framework and found it very nice to work with, pretty simple and clean,
I already had a Java Programming course last semester and I'm currently taking a C# one so I was already familiar with  
programming fundamentals and it was relatively easy to catch up, especially because the syntax is very clean and beginner 
friendly.

I already learnt some JavaScript last summer so that was very helpful, I was thinking that it would be a good idea using 
everything I learnt and do all in vanilla JavaScript but as I had limited time due to the assignment deadline I chose to use
jQuery as it is very easy to use and helped me a lot in regards to animations.

And finally my CSS code is really a shame, I haven't really studied CSS that much so there are serious bad practices going on 
right there (I mean it, like just label and id selectors), all templates are not responsive but I still managed to put them 
together regardless of my lack of CSS proficiency.

(Most of my comments and logic is in spanish so my classmates understand what is going on with my code)
