# MochileApp-Flask

The goal of this app is to make it easy for a hypothetical tourism company to provide their services to schools, since it is a
common practice here in Chile to travel with your classmates in your final year of school it makes a lot of sense.

## Tools I'm using:
* **SQL** - with a relational database (**MySQL**), for data storage.
* **Python** - with **Flask** web framework, for tasks like routing, template rendering and more.
* **JavaScript** - for front-end logic such as form validation, AJAX calls to the server and some UI animations (using **jQuery**)
* **HTML/CSS** - (very bad CSS) for core front-end.

### References:
I'm using a very beautiful animation in my home template which was made with TweenMax.js animation library and I got it from here:

Most of the icons and images I used I got them from here:

### Considerations:
*  I learnt Python while a was learning to use the Flask framework and by reading the book [Learn Python 3 The Hard Way](https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Python-Hard-Way-Introduction/dp/0134692888) by Zed Shaw (which helped me the most), and I found it to be a very nice language to work with, pretty simple and clean, I already had a Java Programming course last semester so I was already familiar with programming fundamentals and it was relatively easy to catch up, especially because the syntax is very clean and beginner friendly.

*  I already learnt some JavaScript through a Udemy course last summer so that was very helpful as it was a very important tool while developing the app, I was thinking that it would be a good idea using everything I learnt and build everything in vanilla JavaScript, but as I had limited time due to the assignment deadline I chose to use some jQuery as it is very easy to use and helped me a lot in regards to animations, but I still did most of my logic and AJAX calls in pure ES6 JavaScript.

*  And finally my CSS code is really a shame, I haven't really studied CSS that much so there are serious bad practices going on there (I mean it, I used mainly id selectors), all templates are not responsive but I still managed to put them 
together regardless of my lack of CSS proficiency and learnt a lot throughout the development of the interfaces, I already got  a course to tackle CSS properly.
